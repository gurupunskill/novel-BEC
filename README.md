### Abstract

Error detection and correction is critical to accurate data transmission, storage and retrieval. Error correction coding (ECC) has been a crucial part of data transmission or storage. In high-reliability applications, the single error correction and double error detections (SEC-DED) Hamming code may not provide adequate protection against burst errors. This makes multiple-error correction (MEC) highly desirable. This paper proposed a novel approach to improving burst errors correction capability of the extended Hamming Code, with the target objective of minimizing the redundancy, while retaining code rate as maximum as possible. Design algorithms of Hamming encoding and decoding are proposed in this paper along with an innovative mode of transmission, and the simplicity and ease of their implementations are demonstrated with example.  

### Objectives

* Implementing standard hamming code encoding and decoding technique to demonstrate correction and detection of errors during transmission.  
* Implementing the novel hamming code encoding and decoding technique to demonstrate correction and detection of errors during transmission.  
* To implement the above two transmissions over a large dataset for the purpose of plotting graphs and visualising the difference in performance of the two schemes.  
* To simulate a data transmission scenario so as to compare and contrast between both the schemes.
